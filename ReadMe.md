Group Work Flow
===============
###Step 1: Create An Organization
From your github dashboard create an Organization. Click on the + sign where you would add a repository, but select **New Organization**.

###Step: 2
Once your organization has been created, it's time to include your team members. 

You can add your team members as administrators or you can create a subteam and choose what kind of access they will have. 

An administrator will be able to merge pull requests to the upstream master. If you restrict your subteams they won't have this control.

There are benefits and drawbacks to both ways, have your team decide what they'd like to do.

###Step: 3

Ok, now that you have your organization setup and you've invited your team, you need a repository to work from. 

1. Create a new repository within your organization
2. Now each team member should fork that repo to their personal github
3. Once you've forked the repo from the organization, clone **YOUR FORK** onto your local machine.
4. Now we need to set an **UPSTREAM MASTER** for the repo on your local machine.
5. Type **git remote -v** into the Terminal while in the directory of the repo you just forked. You'll see that your fork on github is the origin.
6. Now we'll add an **UPSTREAM MASTER**. Type **git remote add upstream** and paste the organizations repo url immediatley after the command. Hit enter.
